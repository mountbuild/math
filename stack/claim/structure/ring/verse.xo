class coordinate ring, or structure ring
  Given a subset V of An, we define I(V) to be the ideal of all polynomial functions vanishing on V:

  I(V)=\left\{f\in k[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]\mid f(x)=0{\text{ for all }}x\in V\right\}.

  For any affine algebraic set V, the coordinate ring or structure ring of V is the quotient of the polynomial ring by this ideal.

  Given a ring R and a two-sided ideal I in R, we may define an equivalence relation ~ on R as follows:

  a ~ b if and only if a âˆ’ b is in I.
  Using the ideal properties, it is not difficult to check that ~ is a congruence relation. In case a ~ b, we say that a and b are congruent modulo I. The equivalence class of the element a in R is given by

  [a] = a + I := { a + r : r in I }.
  This equivalence class is also sometimes written as a mod I and called the "residue class of a modulo I".

  The set of all such equivalence classes is denoted by R/I; it becomes a ring, the factor ring or quotient ring of R modulo I, if one defines

  (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I;
  (a + I)(b + I) = (a b) + I.
  (Here one has to check that these definitions are well-defined. Compare coset and quotient group.) The zero-element of R/I is (0 + I) = I, and the multiplicative identity is (1 + I).
